# openIMIS Frontend Social Protection module

This repository holds the files of the openIMIS Frontend Social Protection module.
It is dedicated to be bootstrap development of [openimis-fe_js](https://github.com/openimis/openimis-fe_js) modules, providing an empty (yet deployable) module.

Please refer to [openimis-fe_js](https://github.com/openimis/openimis-fe_js) to see how to build and deploy (in developement or server mode).

The module is built with [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).
In development mode, you can use `npm link` and `npm start` to continuously scan for changes and automatically update your development server.

### Publishing

Before publishing the package make sure the compiled `dist/` folder is generated. The `prepublishOnly` and `prepare` scripts will run `npm run build` automatically, but you can also execute it manually:

```bash
npm run build            # generate files in dist/
```

Run `npm pack --dry-run` to verify the contents of the package; `dist/index.js` and `dist/index.es.js` should be listed.

Publish with:

```bash
npm publish              # will include dist/ thanks to "files" in package.json
```

Version numbers should be bumped (e.g. `0.1.2` or above) so that dist files are part of the release.
